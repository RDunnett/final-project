                    <p>J.M. Automotive began its journey in 2010 when Jim McKenny laid the foundation in Kemptville. What started as a vision to offer exceptional automotive care blossomed into a thriving family-owned establishment. Over the years, our commitment to quality service and dedication to our rural community have been the pillars of our growth. Today, J.M. Automotive stands tall, a testament to our founder's passion and our team's unwavering dedication to excellence in auto repair and customer satisfaction.</p>
                    <p class="h2 fw-bold">Inclusivity</p>
                    <p>We are committed to inclusivity so that we can to positive social change. By being an ally and standing against discrimination, we become part of a movement towards equality and justice. Our actions, whether big or small, can make a significant impact fostering a more inclusive and accepting society. we can create a safe and supportive environment individuals from the 2slgbtqia+ community.

                    <p class="h2 fw-bold">Land acknowledgement</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge that we work and live on aboriginal land that has been inhabited by Indigenous peoples from the beginning. As
                      settlers, we're grateful for the opportunity to be here and we thank all the generations of people who have taken care of this land -
                      for thousands of years. Long before today, as we work here, there have been aboriginal peoples who have been the stewards of this
                      place In particular, we acknowledge the traditional territory of the Anishnabek, Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois),
                      Oneida and Haudenosaunee (St Lawrence Iroquois) peoples. This territory is covered by the Upper Canada Treaties. We recognize
                      and deeply appreciate their historic connection to this place. We also recognize the contributions of MÃ©tis, Inuit, and other
                      Indigenous peoples have made, both in shaping and strengthening this community in particular, and our province and country as a
                      whole. As settlers, this recognition of the contributions and historic importance of Indigenous peoples must also be clearly and
                      overtly connected to our collective commitment to make the promise and the challenge of Truth and Reconciliation real in our
                      communities, and in particular to bring justice for murdered and missing indigenous women and girls across our country.
